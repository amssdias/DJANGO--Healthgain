HealthGain Project

Website where user can track what he have eated, (calories, protein ,etc). We will have a small part where we will display recipes, and maybe in the future a blog section where everyone can share their experience. 
The user will be able to add his own food to a big list of foods, and then put some of the foods into his favourites. He will be able to add that specific food and the amount of grams he consumed, same as drinks.

    - X Users
    - X Profile user (Name, age, weight, height, BMI, weight goal) - Many to many list of foods
    - X Daily User dashboard food intake (user, food, grams, day) - User, Foreign Key
    - X Food (name, brand, weight, calories, Total fat, Carbohydrate, Fibre, Protein, upload picture, date created, FOREIGN KEY USER)
        (User foreign key, so we know all the ones he created, will be in his food list automatically, but can't be shown in others users)
